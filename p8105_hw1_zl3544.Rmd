```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
This is my solution for P8105 hw1

load the tidyverse function for hw1
```{r library, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
Problem 1

The problem focus on writing a short description of the penguins dataset which include:

* the data in this dataset, including names / values of important variables

* the size of the dataset

* the mean flipper length

Load the penguins dataset from the palmerpenguins package:
```{r load_penguins}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```
The names of the data in penguins dataset is showed using the following code:
```{r plot_names, collapse=TRUE}
ls(penguins)
```
It shows that the names in the penguins dataset are: `r ls(penguins)`
